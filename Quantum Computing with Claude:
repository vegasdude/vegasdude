# Qubit Basics

## What is a Qubit?
A quantum bit (qubit) is the fundamental unit of quantum information.

## Key Properties
- Superposition: Can exist in multiple states simultaneously
- State representation: |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
- Probability: |α|² + |β|² = 1

## Bloch Sphere
Visual representation of qubit states on a unit sphere.

## Examples
[Add code examples and visualizations here]
```

```python
# Basic Quantum Circuit with Qiskit

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Create a quantum circuit with 2 qubits and 2 classical bits
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

# Apply Hadamard gate to first qubit
qc.h(0)

# Apply CNOT gate
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Measure
qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

# Simulate
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
job = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1000)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts(qc)

print("Measurement results:", counts)

# Effective Claude Prompts for Quantum Computing

## Circuit Design
"Help me design a quantum circuit that creates a Bell state using Qiskit. 
Explain each gate and why it's needed."

## Algorithm Implementation
"Walk me through implementing Grover's algorithm for a 3-qubit search problem. 
Include the oracle design and amplitude amplification steps."

## Debugging
"I'm getting unexpected measurement results in my quantum circuit. 
Here's my code: [paste code]. What might be causing this?"

## Concept Clarification
"Explain quantum entanglement using a simple analogy, then show me 
how to create entangled qubits in code."

## Optimization
"Review my quantum circuit and suggest ways to reduce gate count 
while maintaining functionality."
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Create the folder structure** on your local machine or cloud storage
2. **Populate with your notes** as you learn
3. **Use Claude** to help fill in content, debug code, and explain concepts
4. **Track progress** by updating your README
5. **Iterate and expand** based on your interests

## 💡 Tips for Working with Claude

- Share your quantum code for debugging and optimization
- Ask for explanations at different complexity levels
- Request visualizations and diagrams
- Use Claude to generate practice problems
- Get help translating between quantum frameworks (Qiskit, Cirq, etc.)

## 📚 Recommended Next Steps

1. Start with fundamentals folder - build strong foundation
2. Experiment with code examples - hands-on practice
3. Document your learning in research notes
4. Build a capstone project combining multiple concepts
